# 07 - Project 1 - Edible Parks

## Project Description

Edible Parks is an app designed to introduce the user to all of the park/ picnic options in a given state. The user can simply select their state to find a list of state parks and will be able to see the park that they choose on an interactive map. Another benefit is that park admission helps to support state wildlife conservation.
